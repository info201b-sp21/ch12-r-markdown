# Exercise-1

## Content:

* YAML header
* code chunks and inline code
* chunk options
* simple random numbers
* simple R plots

## Your task

As in previous exercises, you should fork and clone this repository,
follow the instructions in `exercise.R` file, then `add` and `commit`
your changes so that you can `push` them back up to Github.

Take the _index.rmd_ file, and edit the text and code chunks
accordingly.  "quote out" the tasks (mark as block quotes) and write
in code to display results and make plots.  In a few places you are
asked to create inline numbers, you have to compute.

## Knitting

Once you've done these steps, you should `knit` your document to
create a file `index.html`.

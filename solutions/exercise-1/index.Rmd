### Exercise 1 ###

library(jsonlite)
library(dplyr)
library(httr)

# Store a variable "movie"
movie <- 'Almost Famous'
# Write a function that allows you to specify a movie, then does the following:
GetReview <- function(movie) {
  
  # Construct a search query using YOUR api key
  # The base URL is https://api.nytimes.com/svc/movies/v2/reviews/search.json?
  # Your parameters should include a "query" and an "api_key"
  # Note: the HTTR library will take care of spaces in the arguments
  # See the interactive console for more detail:https://developer.nytimes.com/movie_reviews_v2.json#/Console/GET/reviews/search.json
  base.url <- 'https://api.nytimes.com/svc/movies/v2/reviews/search.json?'
  api.key <- "2d3963db35bb4d0f88f17a193b8c62e8"
  query.params <- list(query=movie, api_key = api.key)
  response <- GET(base.url, query = query.params)
  body <- content(response, "text")
  
  # Request data using your search query
  results <- fromJSON(body)
  
  
   ## Flatten the data stored in the `$results` key of the data returned to you
  
   ## From the most recent review, store the headline, short summary, and link to full article
   ## each in their own variables

# Create a variable called `movie.info` by passing your movie to your GetReview function
movie.info <- GetReview(movie)
```
   ## Return an list of the three pieces of information from above:
   ## return(list(summary, headline, link))
  
}

## get your API key.
## Mine is stored in the file "nyt_movie_reviews_api"
## you should not insert this in the code and upload to github.
api.key <- readLines("~/Documents/keys/nyt_movie_reviews_api")

### Store the name of the movie in a variable

### Create a variable called `movie.info` by passing the movie name variable to your GetReview function
